This section describes tree tiling and tree reordering, two optimizations performed at the highest 
level of abstraction. Recall that at this level the \op{predictForest} operator is abstractly
represented by a set of decision trees.

% \section{Putting it all together}
% Sections~\ref{Sec:HIR} to \ref{Sec:LIR} present various composable optimizations different combinations 
% of which may be needed for different models on different targets. Some of these optimizations like 
% tiling and tree walk interleaving are parameterized to control how aggressively they are applied. 
% In order to find the best combination of optimizations and parameters, several configurations were explored
% for each benchmark. The grid of optimizations explored is listed in Table~\ref{Tab:Optimizations}. 
% \begin{table}[htbp]
%   \small{
%   \begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{l l}
%    \toprule
%    \textbf{Optimization} & \textbf{Configurations}\\
%    \midrule
%    \multirow{2}{*}{\texttt{Loop order}} &  One tree at a time\\
%                        &  One row at a time\\
%    \midrule
%    \texttt{Tile size} & 1, 2, 4, 8 \\
%    \midrule
%    \multirow{2}{*}{\texttt{Tiling type}} & Basic tiling\\
%    & Probability-based tiling \\
%    \midrule
%    \texttt{Tree padding and unrolling} & Yes, No \\
%    \midrule
%    \texttt{Tree walk interleaving} & 2, 4, 8 \\
%    \bottomrule
%   \end{tabularx}

% \end{table}
% In the current implementation, we exhaustively explore the grid of optimizations for each 
% model that is compiled. We intend to build an auto-tuner to search over the optimization 
% space more efficiently.
